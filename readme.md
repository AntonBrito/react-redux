# React Redux

# Learning Objectives

  - Explain the advantages of having a single, immutable container-object managing your application's state
  - Explain the role of the store in a React app and how it influences the architecture of a React app
  - Explain the role of the store
  - Explain the roles of actions & dispatches

# Immutable State Tree

  - Redux encapsulates the state of an application in a single object
  - This object is called the Immutable State Tree
    - What does immutable mean? Why immutable? Why would it make sense for the tree to be read-only?
    - What is a tree? Why would state be stored in tree form?
